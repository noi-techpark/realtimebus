PARTLY DEPRECATED

This repository contains the client and the server part.

The server part is deprecated. Please use:

For the client part, we will still use the source code in this repository, until we will create a new version of the client as well.


realtimebus
===========

Real Time Bus Notification System

realtimebus is the code base of http://bus.meran.eu a web interface written in PHP, which displays the real time positions of the public transport vehicles managed by SASA in South Tyrol.

Architecture
============

SASA has provided its data as Open Data. Documentation can be found on the http://sasabus.org/opendata web site.

The realtimebus component connects to a http://FreeGIS.net installation installed on the SASA server infrastructure, which exposes real time data by SASA over web services.
